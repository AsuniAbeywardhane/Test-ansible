**Best practices used**

- Private IP address of the remote host machine has been used to log in.
- Instead of using passwords, public key authentication has been used for more secure connectivity.
- From the security groups, SSH restrictions have been established.(Only the incoming traffic from the specified hosts are accepted)

NOTE: It was assumed that python2 was installed in the host machine.
