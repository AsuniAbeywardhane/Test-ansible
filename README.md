# Test-ansible

**Best practices used**

- Private IP address of the remote host machine has been used to log in.
- Instead of using passwords, public key authentication has been used to for connecting securely.
- From the security groups, SSH restrictions have been established.(Only the specified hosts have the access for the incoming traffic.)

NOTE: It was assumed that python2 and python3 were installed in the host machine.
